Hi, I'm Maria, a full-stack developer with education in Communication and Marketing.

What is Code to impact? It's my personal branding.

My way of seeing life and my way of unifying all my knowledge.

I love doing development but even more I like the creative part, the one that impacts and you can remember it for days. This is my code, this is my branding.
